# mouse sense matcher
mouse_sense_matcher is a simple tool to help you match your mouse sensitivity for any game.

## 1. Measure your reference mouse sensitivity
Start the game whose mouse sense you want to use as reference for all others.
Position your crosshair on a remarkable position like the edge of a wall.

Press **F9** key to start the measurement.

Use your mouse or the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow key on your keyboard to perform a 360° rotation either clock or counter clockwise.

Then press **F9** again to complete the measurement.

During and after the measurement the raw distance in pixels will be shown.
It is recommended to note down this value for future usage so you can then put it in by pressing **F8** instead of performing the measurement again.

## 2. Determine the sensitivity for your new game
Start the game whose mouse sense you want to match with your measured reference sense.

### hip sensitivity
Press the **F10** key to repeat your measurement.
If your rotation is not exactly 360° you can press **F10** again to rotate back to the start position.
Increase or decrease your hip sense and try this procedure as often as needed to match your hip sense as good as possible to the reference sense.

### ADS (aim down sight) sensitivity
Depending on your game settings you need to press the **F5** key once when you use right mouse click to toggle between hip and ADS mode.
If you use right mouse click hold to switch between hip and ADS mode, you do not have to press this key.

Press the **F11** key when your preferred ADS sense is the same as your hip sense or the **F12** key when your preffered ADS sense is 50% of your hip sense.
The programm will then automatically handle the right mouse click to switch into ADS and then perform the rotation.

You then have to perform the same procudure as described for the hip sense to determine your ADS sense.
